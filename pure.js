/**
 * A pure function is a function that returns a value thatâ€™s computed based
 * on its arguments. Pure functions take at least one argument and always
 * return a value or another function. They do not cause side effects, set
 * global variables, or change anything about application state. They treat
 * their arguments as immutable data.
